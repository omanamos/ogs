Problem: Take one recipe ingredient and provide scored matches from a grocery inventory list (GIL).

Solution:
1 - GIL is very dirty, need to clean it up and remove non-food items
        -could be done through manual filtering, mechanical turk, filtering based on categories, etc
2 - Write a script to view all grocery items in one category



Category Notes:
----------------------------
Investigate grocery items that don't have 3 categories. Are they included in the sql query that loads the grocery inventory? Should they be?
