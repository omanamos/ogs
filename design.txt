Problem: Take one recipe ingredient and provide scored matches from a grocery inventory list (GIL).

Solution:
1 - GIL is very dirty, need to clean it up and remove non-food items
        -could be done through manual filtering, mechanical turk, filtering based on categories, etc
2 - Write a script to view all grocery items in one category



Category Notes:
----------------------------
Investigate grocery items that don't have 3 categories. Are they included in the sql query that loads the grocery inventory? Should they be?

Investigate grocery items that are duplicated. Are they errors?

START HERE: IngredientMatcher.java, Inventory.java, Ingredient.java


Useful: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.ogs.test.Main"


Ingredient Grammar:
-----------------------------------
<ingredient> = "<quantity> <name>"
<quantity> = "<quantifier>|<quantifier> <measurement>|<quantifier> (<quantity>) <measurement>"
<quantifier> = "<number>|<number>/<number>"
<measurement> = "<container>|<measuring instrument>"

Use grammmar? Or just do word overlap lookup (use full grocery name so quantity also matches)
*****IMPT*****    - need to break do word overlap wrt to a very simple grammar (ie keep "2 ounces" instead of breaking into "2" and "ounces")
